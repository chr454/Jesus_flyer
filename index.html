        <h1>ARE YOU SAVED?</h1>
        <p>To be saved is to be delivered from the condemnation of sin by faith in christ Jesus our Lord.<br> Whoever with his heart believes in the Gospel of christ[The good news of his birth, death and resurrection for the cleansing of our sins and salvation] is a saved soul[1st corinth 15:1-4]</p>
            <h2>WHAT THEN HAPPENS AFTER SALVATION?</h2>
            <p>Dear Friends, Salvation is not the end but the means to an end. This End we talk about is eternal life.Salvation calls us into a new life in christ.A life free from  and above sin. Hence we are to walk out our salvation by giving our self to the studying of his word and in prayers. Daily fellowship with God in prayer and his word, spreading his truth and service in his kingdom is how we walk out our salvation.</p>
